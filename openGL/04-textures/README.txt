Compile the code.

The run it with a Wavefront file like this on the command line:

    ./shader ../data/cube.obj 
    ./shader ../data/carpet.obj 
    ./shader ../data/teapot.obj 
    ./shader ../data/triceratops.obj

Or run it with the above command-line arguments in Windows Visual
Studio.

Look at the terminal window for instructions and the current rendering
and texture modes.

You might have to click in the rendering window before it accepts any
key commands.
