CISC 454 Assignment 4
Due Friday, April 5 at noon


You are to modify a raytracer to add refraction and to add pixel
antialising with jittering.  See "YOUR CODE HERE" in scene.cpp.
Change only the code in scene.cpp.

On Linux and MacOS, run the program as

  ./rt ../worlds/basic
  ./rt ../worlds/transparent

  On Windows Visual Studio, include "..\worlds\basic" or
  "..\worlds\transparent" in the Debugging command-line arguments.
  
In the raytracing window

  As long as you're dragging the mouse to shift the viewpoint, the
  scene will be redrawn quickly using OpenGL.  As soon as you stop
  dragging the mouse, the raytracing code is called, and eventually a
  raytraced image is shown.  You can drag the mouse again while the
  raytracing is being done; the raytracing will be restarted as soon
  as you stop dragging.

  In the rendering window, press '?' to get a list of options in the
  console window.  These options allow you to change many things,
  including the number of sample rays and jittering.

  Click the mouse on a pixel to see the rays traced through that
  pixel.  You can use the right mouse button to rotate the scene to
  see the rays from a different viewpoint.  The rays are coloured:

    blue:   a ray that hit an object
    grey:   a ray that did not hit an object
    yellow: a shadow ray that was sent toward a point light source

To Hand In

  Make a directory called 'a4'.  In that directory, put

    - schene.cpp
    - README.txt     with your name(s) and netID(s)

  Create a zip archive z4.zip of the a4 directory and submit it to OnQ.

  Follow these submission instructions exactly.
